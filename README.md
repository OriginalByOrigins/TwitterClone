# TwitterNewFeedClone is an app that imitates the Home New Feed page of the twitter app.

The app is written in Swift 3 using UIkit framework for designing UI, TRON framework and SwiftyJSON framework for getting data from a server.

And of course, this app is a good example to learn the basic of several concepts such as: MVC model, Singleton model,...

<-- I am an anti-storyboard person, so all the UI in this project are designed programmatically by codes -->
